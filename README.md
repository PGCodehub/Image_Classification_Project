# Image Classification Project

The Image Classification Project is trained on Flower dataset with 101 categories and has to code in train.py to 
train on different datasets using Transfer Learning


Specifications
The project includes two files train.py and predict.py. The first file, train.py, will train a new network on a dataset and save the model as a checkpoint. The second file, predict.py, uses a trained network to predict the class for an input image. F

##Train a new network on a data set with train.py

Basic usage: python train.py data_directory
Prints out training loss, validation loss, and validation accuracy as the network trains
Options:
Set directory to save checkpoints: python train.py data_dir --save_dir save_directory
Choose architecture: python train.py data_dir --arch "vgg13"
Set hyperparameters: python train.py data_dir --learning_rate 0.01 --hidden_units 512 --epochs 20
Use GPU for training: python train.py data_dir --gpu

--arch is for basic Networks and --hidden_units for custom heads


##Predict flower name from an image with predict.py along with the probability of that name.

That is, you'll pass in a single image /path/to/image and return the flower name and class probability.

Basic usage: python predict.py /path/to/image checkpoint
Options:
Return top KK most likely classes: python predict.py input checkpoint --top_k 3
Use a mapping of categories to real names: python predict.py input checkpoint --category_names cat_to_name.json
Use GPU for inference: python predict.py input checkpoint --gpu
